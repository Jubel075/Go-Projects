## 🧠 Key Takeaways (So Far)

> “The simplicity of Go is deceptive — it hides deep power beneath clear syntax.”

- Go encourages **composition over inheritance**  
- **Error handling** is explicit, not exceptional  
- **Goroutines** make concurrency intuitive  
- **Interfaces** are implicit — they just work  
- **Tooling** is first-class: `go fmt`, `go test`, `go run`, `go mod`, etc.
